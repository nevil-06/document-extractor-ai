# üìö Document Embedding & Retrieval Framework

## ‚ú® Introduction

This advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework is engineered to streamline document understanding and answer generation by blending state-of-the-art NLP technologies. It processes diverse documents, transforms text into semantic vectors, performs efficient vector searches, and leverages generative AI models to deliver context-rich responses to user inquiries.

The system‚Äôs modular design integrates semantic vector search alongside knowledge graph structures:

Document Processing Module: Extracts and segments document content for embedding

Vector Storage: Facilitates high-speed similarity retrieval using optimized indexes

Knowledge Graph Module: Captures entity-level connections between document fragments

RAG Engine: Coordinates the retrieval of information and the generation of answers

Language Model Interface: Produces detailed and relevant responses based on retrieved data

Users can engage with the system through a Streamlit-based frontend, while programmatic access is available via a FastAPI backend.
